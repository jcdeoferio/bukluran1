Bukluran: Registration Done with Ease

The University of the Philippines has hundreds of student organizations. Each year, these organizations, fraternities, sororities, and the like apply for recognition to the university – submission of paper documents and other imperatives are done to accomplish such application. In effect, the Office of Student Activities (OSA) encounters difficulties in handling such numerous applications.

With Bukluran, these organizations and the OSA will no longer have to face the hassles of manual application. Bukluran guarantees faster and easier registration and processing, through an online system that organizes all documents and forms from the organizations.

Bukluran features groups for different types of users. There are three types of user groups: the organizations, the OSA, and the administrator. The organizations use their registered organization accounts, which they use for interacting and connecting with Bukluran. The OSA has a special account, the OSA account, which they use for accessing and viewing the organizations' information and data stored in the Bukluran database. Finally, the administrator account, accessed by Bukluran's administrators, is used for maintenance and development of the system.

Possible problems encountered with paper-copied documents, such as data losses, deterioration, and mishandling, are minimized with Bukluran's virtual storage. Furthermore, time and space are conserved – caching and retrieval of information are now done with just a click of a button, and documents are now in softcopy form, minimizing the use of physical space.

Security of information within Bukluran is assured to all registered organizations. Confidential information of the organizations which are stored in the Bukluran database are kept private. Access to these data are limited only to the organization associated with the aforementioned information, and to OSA as well.
